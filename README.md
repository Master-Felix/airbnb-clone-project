# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive full-stack development exercise inspired by the popular booking platform, Airbnb. The aim of this project is to simulate the design and development of a scalable, secure, and feature-rich web application that allows users to list, discover, and book accommodations.

This project serves as a deep dive into backend development, database design, API security, CI/CD integration, and collaborative team workflows—preparing developers for real-world software engineering challenges.

## Project Goals

- Build a scalable and secure backend system using Django.
- Design a relational database using MySQL to store user, property, and booking data.
- Develop RESTful (and optionally GraphQL) APIs to support frontend communication.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.
- Strengthen collaborative development through GitHub workflows and documentation.
