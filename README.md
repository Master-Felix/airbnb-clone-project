- `owner_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Users.id)
- `title` (VARCHAR)
- `description` (TEXT)
- `location` (VARCHAR)
- `price_per_night` (DECIMAL)

### 3. **Bookings**

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Users.id)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Properties.id)
- `start_date` (DATE)
- `end_date` (DATE)
- `total_price` (DECIMAL)

### 4. **Reviews**

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Users.id)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Properties.id)
- `rating` (INT)
- `comment` (TEXT)

### 5. **Payments**

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key ‚Üí Bookings.id)
- `amount` (DECIMAL)
- `payment_method` (VARCHAR)
- `status` (ENUM: "pending", "completed", "failed")

---

### üîó Entity Relationships

![ERD](/ERD.png)

- A **User** can own multiple **Properties** (One-to-Many).
- A **User** can make multiple **Bookings** (One-to-Many).
- A **Property** can have multiple **Bookings** (One-to-Many).
- A **Booking** is associated with one **User** and one **Property** (Many-to-One).
- A **User** can leave multiple **Reviews** for different **Properties**.
- A **Property** can have multiple **Reviews** (One-to-Many).
- Each **Booking** has one corresponding **Payment** (One-to-One).

## Feature Breakdown

This section outlines the core features of the Airbnb Clone project, each of which contributes to building a robust, user-centric booking platform.

### 1. **User Management**

Users can register, log in, update their profiles, and securely manage their account credentials. This feature ensures personalized experiences and supports role-based actions like hosting or booking properties.

### 2. **Property Management**

Registered users can list their properties by adding details such as title, description, location, price per night, and photos. This feature enables property owners to showcase and manage their listings on the platform.

### 3. **Booking System**

Users can search for available properties and make bookings for specific dates. The system calculates total cost, checks for availability, and prevents overlapping reservations‚Äîensuring a smooth reservation experience.

### 4. **Review & Rating System**

After completing a booking, users can leave a review and rate the property. This encourages quality service and builds trust within the platform by allowing future guests to make informed decisions.

### 5. **Payment Integration**

The platform supports payment processing tied to bookings, ensuring transactions are tracked and securely handled. Users can choose payment methods and view the status of their payments.

### 6. **Authentication & Authorization**

The app uses secure authentication mechanisms, including password hashing and session/token-based access control. This safeguards user data and restricts access to authorized content and actions.

### 7. **Admin Dashboard (Optional Advanced Feature)**

Admins can monitor system activity, manage users, review listings, and resolve disputes. This ensures platform integrity and operational oversight.

## API Security

Securing the backend API is critical to maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the system. Below are key security measures implemented in the Airbnb Clone project and their significance:

### üîê Authentication

**What it is**: Validates the identity of users using secure login mechanisms (e.g., token-based authentication like JWT or session-based login).
**Why it matters**: Ensures only verified users can access protected routes, protecting sensitive data such as booking history and payment details.

### üîí Authorization

**What it is**: Determines what resources a user can access based on their role (e.g., host, guest, admin).
**Why it matters**: Prevents unauthorized access to actions such as editing properties or viewing another user's information.

### üìà Rate Limiting

**What it is**: Controls the number of API requests a user or IP can make in a given timeframe.
**Why it matters**: Prevents abuse, brute-force login attempts, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that can slow or crash the server.

### üßº Input Validation & Sanitization

**What it is**: Cleans and checks all incoming data for expected formats.
**Why it matters**: Protects the system from common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

### üßæ Secure Payment Handling

**What it is**: Uses encrypted communication channels and third-party payment gateways to handle transactions.
**Why it matters**: Ensures users' financial data remains private and that payments are processed safely and accurately.

### üîê HTTPS Enforcement

**What it is**: Forces all requests to go through encrypted HTTPS connections.
**Why it matters**: Protects data in transit from being intercepted or tampered with during communication between client and server.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment**. It is a set of practices and tools that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. This ensures that every code change is automatically validated and deployed, minimizing human error and accelerating the development cycle.

### Why It Matters

- **Faster Development**: Automates testing and deployment, allowing features and fixes to reach production faster.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Automatically runs tests and linting to catch bugs early in the development process.
- **Team Collaboration**: Streamlines integration of contributions from multiple developers, reducing merge conflicts and deployment issues.
- **Reliability**: Ensures consistent environments across development, staging, and production.

### Tools We Use

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows like testing, linting, and deployment on every push or pull request.
- **Docker**: Creates isolated environments to run the application, ensuring consistency across different machines and stages.
- **MySQL Service**: Used in CI to test database interactions during automated builds.
- **Optional**: Tools like **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **Render** for deployment depending on the hosting setup.
